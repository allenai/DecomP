QC: Reverse the sequence "driving license, button, packet, identity card, shoe".
QS: The sequence is "1. driving license, 2. button, 3. packet, 4. identity card, 5. shoe". The sequence is 5 items long, which is more than the minimum length of 4, so we split it. Half of 5 is 5 / 2 = 2.5. Dropping the decimal, we get that the first half will be 2 items long, ending in "2. button". The first half (2 items) is "1. driving license, 2. button". The first half of the sequence ends with "2. button", so the second half starts after "2. button" with "3. packet". The full sequence is 5 items long, and the first half is 2 items long, so the second half will be 5 - 2 = 3 items long. The second half of the sequence (3 items) is "3. packet, 4. identity card, 5. shoe". Removing the numbers from "1. driving license, 2. button", we get "driving license, button". Removing the numbers from "3. packet, 4. identity card, 5. shoe", we get "packet, identity card, shoe". Reversing the sequence "driving license, button", First is driving license. Second is button. Now to reverse, change the order to: Second is button. First is driving license. So the answer is "button, driving license". Reversing the sequence "packet, identity card, shoe", First is packet. Second is identity card. Third is shoe. Now to reverse, change the order to: Third is shoe. Second is identity card. First is packet. So the answer is "shoe, identity card, packet". Joining "shoe, identity card, packet" and "button, driving license", the answer is "shoe, identity card, packet, button, driving license".
A: "shoe, identity card, packet, button, driving license"

QC: Reverse the sequence "newspaper, glasses, laptop, bottle".
QS: The sequence is "1. newspaper, 2. glasses, 3. laptop, 4. bottle". The sequence is 4 items long, which is equal to the minimum length of 4, so we split it. Half of 4 is 4 / 2 = 2.0. Dropping the decimal, we get that the first half will be 2 items long, ending in "2. glasses". The first half (2 items) is "1. newspaper, 2. glasses". The first half of the sequence ends with "2. glasses", so the second half starts after "2. glasses" with "3. laptop". The full sequence is 4 items long, and the first half is 2 items long, so the second half will be 4 - 2 = 2 items long. The second half of the sequence (2 items) is "3. laptop, 4. bottle". Removing the numbers from "1. newspaper, 2. glasses", we get "newspaper, glasses". Removing the numbers from "3. laptop, 4. bottle", we get "laptop, bottle". Reversing the sequence "newspaper, glasses", First is newspaper. Second is glasses. Now to reverse, change the order to: Second is glasses. First is newspaper. So the answer is "glasses, newspaper". Reversing the sequence "laptop, bottle", First is laptop. Second is bottle. Now to reverse, change the order to: Second is bottle. First is laptop. So the answer is "bottle, laptop". Joining "bottle, laptop" and "glasses, newspaper", the answer is "bottle, laptop, glasses, newspaper".
