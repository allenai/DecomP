QC: Take the last letters of the words in "Augusta Ada King" and concatenate them using a space.
QS: The words in "Augusta Ada King" are "Augusta", "Ada" and "King". The letters and their positions in "Augusta" are "[(A, 1), (u, 2), (g, 3), (u, 4), (s, 5), (t, 6), (a, 7)]". The last letter in this sequence is "a". The letters and their positions in "Ada" are "[(A, 1), (d, 2), (a, 3)]". The last letter in this sequence is "a". The letters and their positions in "King" are "[(K, 1), (i, 2), (n, 3), (g, 4)]". The last letter in this sequence is "g". Concatenating "a", "a", "g" using a space leads to "a a g". So, "Augusta Ada King" outputs "a a g".
A: "a a g"

QC: Take the letters at position 4 of the words in "Oren Etzioni AllenInstitute" and concatenate them.
QS: The words in "Oren Etzioni AllenInstitute" are "Oren", "Etzioni" and "AllenInstitute". The letters and their positions in "Oren" are [(O, 1), (r, 2), (e, 3), (n, 4)]. The letter at position 4 in this sequence is "n". The letters and their positions in "Etzioni" are [(E, 1), (t, 2), (z, 3), (i, 4), (o, 5), (n, 6), (i, 7)]. The letter at position 4 in this sequence is "i". The letters and their positions in "AllenInstitute" are [(A, 1), (l, 2), (l, 3), (e, 4), (n, 5), (I, 6), (n, 7), (s, 8), (t, 9), (i, 10), (t, 11), (u, 12), (t, 13), (e, 14)]. The letter at position 4 in this sequence is "e". Concatenating "n", "i", "e" leads to "n i e". So, "Oren Etzioni AllenInstitute" outputs "n i e".
A: "n i e"

QC: Take the letters at position 1 of the words in "Alan Mathison Turing" and concatenate them using a space.
QS: The words in "Alan Mathison Turing" are "Alan", "Mathison",  and "Turing". The letters and their positions in "Alan" are "[(A, 1), (l, 2), (a, 3), (n, 4)]". The letter at position 1 in this sequence is "A". The letters and their positions in "Mathison" are [(M, 1), (a, 2), (t, 3), (h, 4), (i, 5), (s, 6), (o, 7), (n, 8)]". The letter at position 1 in this sequence is "M". The letters and their positions in "Turing" are "[(T, 1), (u, 2), (r, 3), (i, 4), (n, 5), (g, 6)]". The letter at position 1 in this sequence is "T". Concatenating "A", "M", "T" using a space leads to "A M T". So, "Alan Mathison Turing" outputs "A M T".
A: "A M T"
