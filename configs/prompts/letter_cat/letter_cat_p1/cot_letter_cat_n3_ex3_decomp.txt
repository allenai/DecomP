QC: Take the last letters of the words in "Augusta Ada King" and concatenate them using a space.
QS: The last letter of "Augusta" is "a". The last letter of "Ada" is "a". The last letter of "King" is "g". Concatenating "a", "a", "g" using a space leads to "a a g". So, "Augusta Ada King" outputs "a a g".
A: "a a g"

QC: Take the letters at position 1 of the words in "Alan Mathison Turing" and concatenate them using a space.
QS: The letter at position 1 of "Alan" is "A". The letter at position 1 of "Mathison" is "M". The letter at position 1 of "Turing" is "T". Concatenating "A", "M", "T" using a space leads to "A M T". So, "Alan Mathison Turing" outputs "A M T".
A: "A M T"

QC: Take the letters at position 4 of the words in "Herbert Alexander Simon" and concatenate them using a space.
QS: The letter at position 4 of "Herbert" is "b". The letter at position 4 of "Alexander" is "x". The letter at position 4 of "Simon" is "o". Concatenating "b", "x", "o" using a space leads to "b x o". So, "Herbert Alexander Simon" outputs "b x o".
A: "b x o"
